<h1>Recovery-Hyper-V-VM-Replication-Guide</h1>

## Introduction

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a cloud-based disaster recovery solution offered by Microsoft Azure that provides businesses with a streamlined way to protect and replicate virtual machines (VMs) from on-premises environments, such as those hosted on Hyper-V, to Azure. ASR enables organizations to ensure business continuity by minimizing downtime and safeguarding essential workloads through automated replication, failover, and failback processes.

### Overview of Azure Site Recovery (ASR)
Azure Site Recovery orchestrates and automates the replication of on-premises VMs to Azure or a secondary datacenter, creating a resilient disaster recovery strategy that can be tested and validated periodically. Supporting Hyper-V, VMware, and physical servers, ASR replicates data to Azure, providing a reliable recovery option. The integrated management and monitoring tools in ASR simplify disaster recovery processes and ensure seamless transitions with minimal disruption.

### Purpose of This Guide
This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for IT administrators and cloud engineers aiming to use ASR for Hyper-V VM replication. It includes step-by-step instructions on setting up, configuring, and managing ASR for Hyper-V VMs in Azure. This documentation will help you:
- **Prepare your environment** by covering prerequisites and setup steps.
- **Configure replication** of Hyper-V VMs to Azure.
- **Manage failover and failback** to reduce downtime during critical scenarios.

### Benefits of Replicating Hyper-V VMs to Azure
Using ASR to replicate Hyper-V VMs to Azure offers several advantages:

- **Enhanced Business Continuity**: ASR automates failover and recovery, minimizing downtime in disaster situations and enabling fast operational resumption.
- **Cost-Effective Disaster Recovery**: Leveraging Azure as a disaster recovery site eliminates the expense of maintaining a secondary datacenter.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Azure’s scalable infrastructure supports workloads of varying sizes, adapting to business growth.
- **Centralized Management and Monitoring**: ASR integrates with the Azure portal, offering easy management and real-time monitoring of replication and failover.
- **Security and Compliance**: ASR provides built-in encryption and aligns with Microsoft’s compliance certifications, ensuring secure replication and failover of workloads.

This guide will help you realize these benefits as you configure and manage ASR for Hyper-V VM replication, establishing a robust disaster recovery strategy.

<img width="1680" alt="17 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9b99a8-1a54-451e-9957-897cb4d02959">

## Managing Replication (Perform test failover)
- To perform a test failover go the vault
- Then go to replicated item and click on the replicated vm
- select the "Test Failover"
- Then cliick ok to start the Test failover
- Wait for it to run finish
<img width="1680" alt="18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef885a5-379d-4d72-8f26-5dfafa9a3220">

After sucessful test failover, a vm replica would have been created and would be in your list of vms in azure 
<img width="1680" alt="19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8af9abc-fcac-4f17-a68a-1a8661fb867a">

After the whole process, you can go back to the particular replicated vm and cleanup the vm, which would delete it.
